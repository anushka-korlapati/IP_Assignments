Advantages of Using OO:
1. In Object oriented programming the user has the ability to define a new type, define variables of this type and invoke operations on it.
2. We can have different user defined data types.

Advantages of using Dictionaries:
1. In Dictionaries, we can associate values to unique keys
2. Dictionaries are faster than other data types

Disadvantage of using OO
1.They are harder to understand, learn and implement in programs
2.The length of programs is longer in case of using OOPs

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1.Dictionaries are unordered and mutable
2.In dictionaries, each dictionary object will be separate, and you will have to write functions 

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N:20
2. Time by OO: 0.004461050033569336
3. Time by dictionary:0.02786707878112793
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: OO is faster by 0.02340602874

Performance comparison for search operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N:20
2. Time by OO:2.0225582122802734
3. Time by dictionary:2.833150625228882
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: OO, by 0.81059241294
